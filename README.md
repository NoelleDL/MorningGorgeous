# Morning Gorgeous

An app that tells you "Morning Gorgeous" with my GitHub profile picture rising behind the sun.

## Process

Decided to play around with a single page app on iOS. I started this app from a tutorial which has a rocket blasting off with sound effects. However, I wanted to be a bit more creative and make my friends laugh so I made some changes by inserting my own photo, changing the 'blast off' sound effects to a magic fairy wand sound effect, and inserted the text "Morning Gorgeous." 

## Installation

* download XCode from the Apple Developer page, `https://developer.apple.com/xcode/`
* clone this repo `https://github.com/NoelleDL/MorningGorgeous`
* connect iOS device, select device in XCode and push the play button
